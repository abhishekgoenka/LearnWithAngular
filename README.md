# LearnWithAngular

LearnWithAngular is an educational repository designed to help developers of all levels learn and master Angular through real-world examples, structured tutorials, and hands-on projects.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
